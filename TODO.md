## Tasks

- simulate link establishment


## Goals

- investigate recovery from link failures
- investigate different node types:
  - forwarder nodes (only forwarding)
  - service nodes (propagating own ID)
  - client nodes (collecting foreign routes)
  - broker nodes (propagating and collecting foreign routes)
- investigate heterogeneous demand for certain services
- use same network for all candidates
- run multiple rounds for each candidate
- write README.md
- split into experimentation framework and routing experiment
